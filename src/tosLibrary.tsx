    tos: `Netflix terms of use
    netflix provides a personalized subscription service that allows our members to access entertainment content ("netflix content") over the internet on certain internet-connected tv's, computers and other devices ("netflix ready devices").
    
    The netflix service is provided to you by netflix inc. You have accepted these terms of use, which govern your use of our service. As used in these terms of use, "netflix service", "our service" or "the service" means the personalized service provided by netflix for discovering and accessing netflix content, including all features and functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our websites, and user interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with our service. References to you in these terms of use indicate the member who created the netflix account and whose payment method is charged.
    
    You agree to the arbitration agreement and class action waiver described in section 7 to resolve any disputes with netflix (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court).
    
    Membership
    
    1.1. Your netflix membership will continue and automatically renew until terminated. To use the netflix service you must have internet access and a netflix ready device and provide us with one or more payment methods. "payment method" means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time and which may include payment through your account with a third party. You must cancel your membership before it renews in order to avoid billing of the membership fees for the next billing cycle to your payment method (see "cancellation" below).
    
    1.2. We may offer a number of membership plans, including memberships offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. Some membership plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your netflix membership by visiting the netflix. Com website and clicking on the "account" link available at the top of the pages under your profile name.
    Promotional offers. We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans or memberships (offers). Offer eligibility is determined by netflix at its sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke an offer and put your account on hold in the event that we determine you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent netflix membership may not be eligible for certain introductory offers. We may use information such as device id, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent netflix membership to determine offer eligibility. The eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions will be disclosed when you sign-up for the offer or in other communications made available to you.
    Billing and cancellation
    
    3.1. Billing cycle. The membership fee for the netflix service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your payment method on the specific payment date indicated on the "account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the service. Membership fees are fully earned upon payment. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your payment method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit the netflix. Com website and click on the "billing details" link on the "account" page to see your next payment date. We may authorize your payment method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. If you signed up for netflix using your account with a third party as a payment method, you can find the billing information about your netflix membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.
    
    3.2. Payment methods. To use the netflix service you must provide one or more payment methods. You authorize us to charge any payment method associated to your account in case your primary payment method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid payment method. For some payment methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your payment method. Check with your payment method service provider for details.
    
    3.3 updating your payment methods. You can update your payment methods by going to the "account" page. We may also update your payment methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable payment method(s).
    
    3.4. Cancellation. You can cancel your netflix membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the netflix service through the end of your billing period. To cancel, go to the "account" page on our netflix. Com website and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, click "billing details" on the "account" page. If you signed up for netflix using your account with a third party as a payment method and wish to cancel your netflix membership, you may need to do so through that third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the netflix service through that third party.
    
    3.5. Changes to the price and subscription plans. We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply no earlier than 30 days following notice to you. If you do not wish to accept the price change or change to your subscription plan, you can cancel your subscription before the change takes effect.
    
    3.6. No refunds. Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used membership periods. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.

    4.3. You may access netflix content primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer your subscription plan and have licensed such content. The content that may be available will vary by geographic location and will change from time to time. Not all netflix content may be available in the ad supported subscription plan. The number of devices on which you may simultaneously watch depends on your chosen subscription plan and is specified on the "account" page.

    4.6. You agree to use the netflix service, including all features and functionalities associated therewith, in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, or other restrictions on use of the service or content therein. Except as explicitly authorized by us, you agree not to:

    We may terminate or restrict your use of our service if you violate these terms of use or are engaged in illegal or fraudulent use of the service.
    
    4.7. The quality of the display of the netflix content may vary from device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your internet connection. Hd, ultra hd and hdr availability is subject to your internet service and device capabilities. Not all content is available in all formats, such as hd, ultra hd or hdr and not all plans allow you to receive content in all formats. The minimum connection speed for hd video quality (defined as a resolution of 720p or higher) is 3.0 mbps per stream; however, we recommend a faster connection for improved video quality. A connection speed of at least 5.0 mbps per stream is recommended to receive full hd video quality (defined as a resolution of 1080p or higher). A connection speed of at least 15.0 mbps per stream is recommended to receive ultra hd video quality (defined as a resolution of 4k or higher). You are responsible for all internet access charges. Please check with your internet provider for information on possible internet data usage charges. Netflix makes no representations or warranties about the quality of your watching experience on your display. The time it takes to begin watching netflix content will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, available bandwidth at the time, the netflix content you have selected and the configuration of your netflix ready device.
    
    4.8. The netflix software is developed by, or for, netflix and may solely be used for authorized streaming and to access content from netflix through netflix ready devices. This software may vary by device and medium, and functionalities may also differ between devices. By using our service, you agree to receive, without further notice or prompting, updated versions of the netflix and related third-party software. If you do not accept the foregoing terms, do not use our service.
    
    4.9. By using our service, you agree to look solely to the entity that manufactured and/or sold you the netflix ready device for any issues related to the device and its compatibility with the netflix service. We do not take responsibility or otherwise warrant the performance of netflix ready devices, including the continued compatibility with our service.
    
    Passwords and account access. You are responsible for any activity that occurs through the netflix account. By allowing others to access the account (which includes access to information on viewing activity for the account), you agree that such individuals are acting on your behalf and that you are bound by any changes that they may make to the account, including but not limited to changes to the subscription plan. To help maintain control over the account and prevent any unauthorized users from accessing the account, you should maintain control over the devices that are used to access the service and not reveal the password or details of the payment method associated to the account to anyone. You agree to provide and maintain accurate information relating to your account, including a valid email address so we can send you account related notices. We can terminate your account or place your account on hold in order to protect you, netflix or our partners from identity theft or other fraudulent activity. Netflix is not obligated to credit or discount a membership for holds placed on the account by either a representative of netflix or by the automated processes of netflix. If your netflix ready device is sold, lost or stolen, please deactivate the netflix ready device. If you fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may access the netflix service through your account and may be able to access certain of your account information. To deactivate a device, follow instructions on the "account" page of our netflix. Com website.
    Disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability
    
    6.1. The netflix service and all content and software associated therewith, or any other features or functionalities associated with the netflix service, are provided "as is" and "as available" with all faults and without warranty of any kind. Netflix does not guarantee, represent, or warrant that your use of the netflix service will be uninterrupted or error-free. Netflix specifically disclaims liability for the use of applications, netflix ready devices, and netflix software (including their continuing compatibility with our service).
    
    6.2. To the extent permissible under applicable laws, in no event shall netflix, or its subsidiaries or any of their shareholders, directors, officers, employees or licensors be liable (jointly or severally) to you for personal injury or any special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind, or any damages whatsoever.
    
    6.3. Depending on your subscription plan, you may encounter third party advertisements on the netflix service. Netflix does not endorse or sponsor any advertised products or services and takes no responsibility for the products or services provided by advertisers. Any interactions with advertisers, including through engagement with interactive advertisements, are at your own option and risk and you agree that netflix is not liable for any damages that you may incur as a result of such interactions.
    
    6.4. Nothing in these terms of use shall affect any non-waivable statutory rights that apply to you.
    Arbitration agreement
    
    7.1. You and netflix agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the netflix service, these terms of use and this arbitration agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award and nothing in this arbitration agreement shall be interpreted as limiting any non-waivable statutory rights. You agree that, by agreeing to these terms of use, the u. S. Federal arbitration act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and netflix are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this agreement and the termination of your netflix membership.
    
    7.2. If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to netflix, by certified mail, a written notice of your claim ("notice"). The notice to netflix must be addressed to: general counsel, netflix, inc. , 121 albright way, los gatos, ca 95032 ("notice address"). If netflix initiates arbitration, it will send a written notice to the email address used for your membership account. A notice, whether sent by you or by netflix, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("demand"). If netflix and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the notice is received, you or netflix may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.
    
    7.3. You may download or copy a form notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www. Adr. Org. If you are required to pay a filing fee, after netflix receives notice at the notice address that you have commenced arbitration, netflix will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than us$10,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.
    
    7.4. The arbitration will be governed by the consumer arbitration rules (the "aaa rules") of the american arbitration association ("aaa"), as modified by this agreement, and will be administered by the aaa. The aaa rules and forms are available online at www. Adr. Org, or by writing to the notice address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Unless netflix and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your residence. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law.
    
    7.5. If your claim is for us$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the aaa rules. If your claim exceeds us$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the aaa rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of netflix's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if netflix did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then netflix will pay you the amount of the award or us$5,000, whichever is greater. Except as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the aaa rules.
    
    7.6. You and netflix agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and netflix agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
    Miscellaneous
    
    8.1. Governing law. These terms of use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of delaware, u. S. A. Without regard to conflict of laws provisions. These terms will not limit any consumer protection rights that you may be entitled to under the mandatory laws of your state of residence.
    
    8.2. Unsolicited materials. Netflix does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas for netflix content, and is not responsible for the similarity of any of its content or programming in any media to materials or ideas transmitted to netflix. Should you send any unsolicited materials or ideas, you do so with the understanding that no additional consideration of any sort will be provided to you, and you are waiving any claim against netflix and its affiliates regarding the use of such materials and ideas, even if material or an idea is used that is substantially similar to the material or idea you sent.
    
    8.3. Feedback. Netflix is free to use any comments, information, ideas, concepts, reviews, or techniques or any other material contained in any communication you may send to us ("feedback"), including responses to questionnaires or through postings to the netflix service, including our websites and user interfaces, worldwide and in perpetuity without further compensation, acknowledgement or payment to you for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and creating, modifying or improving the netflix service. In addition, you agree not to enforce any "moral rights" in and to the feedback, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
    
    8.4. Customer support. To find more information about our service and its features, or if you need assistance with your account, please visit the netflix help center, which is accessible through the netflix. Com website. In certain instances, customer service may best be able to assist you by using a remote access support tool through which we have full access to your computer. If you do not want us to have this access, you should not consent to support through the remote access tool, and we will assist you through other means. In the event of any conflict between these terms of use and information provided by customer service or other portions of our websites, these terms of use will control.
    
    8.5. Survival. If any provision or provisions of these terms of use shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
    
    8.6. Changes to terms of use and assignment. Netflix may, from time to time, change these terms of use. Such revisions shall be effective immediately; provided however, for existing members, such revisions shall, unless otherwise stated, be effective 30 days after posting. We may assign our agreement with you to any affiliated company or to any entity that succeeds to all or substantially all of our business or assets related to the applicable netflix service.
    
    8.7. Communication preferences. We will send you information relating to your account (e. G. Payment authorizations, invoices, changes in password or payment method, confirmation messages, notices) in electronic form only, for example via emails to your email address provided during registration. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.`,

    paying a subscription fee plus applicable taxes in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or
    prepayment giving you access to the spotify service for a specific time period ("prepaid period").
    Tax rates are calculated based on the information you provide and the applicable rate at the time of your monthly charge.

Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change and, by continuing to use the spotify service after the price change takes effect, you will have accepted the new price. If you do not agree to a price change, you can reject the change by unsubscribing from the applicable paid subscription prior to the price change going into effect.
    
    Tax rates are based on the rates applicable at the time of your monthly charge. These amounts can change over time with local tax requirements in your country, state, territory, county, or city.

    Renewal and cancellation
    
    with the exception of paid subscriptions for a prepaid period, your payment to spotify or the third party through which you purchased the paid subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your paid subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. Contact our customer support team here for instructions on how to cancel. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free version of the spotify service. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, except as expressly stated in these terms.
    
    If you have purchased a paid subscription using a code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated with your code, or when there is an insufficient prepaid balance to pay for the spotify service.

    these terms will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or spotify. Spotify may terminate these terms (including any additional terms and conditions incorporated herein) or suspend your access to the spotify service at any time if we believe you have breached any of these terms, if we stop providing the spotify service or any material component thereof, or as we believe necessary to comply with applicable law.

    Warranty disclaimers
    the spotify service is provided "as is" and "as available, " without any warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory. Further, spotify and all owners of the content disclaim any express, implied, and statutory warranties regarding the content, including warranties of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Neither spotify nor any owner of content warrants that the spotify service or content is free of malware or other harmful components. In addition, spotify makes no representation regarding, nor does it warrant or assume any responsibility for, any third-party applications (or the content thereof), user content, devices or any product or service advertised, promoted or offered by a third party on or through the spotify service or any hyperlinked website, and spotify is not responsible for any transactions between you and any third-party providers of the foregoing. No advice or information whether oral or in writing obtained by you from spotify shall create any warranty on behalf of spotify. While using the spotify service, you may have access to explicit content filtering features, but use of these features may still result in some explicit content being served and you should not rely on such features to filter all explicit content. This section applies to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
    
    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the exclusion and limitations in this section may not apply to you.
    
    Limitation of liability and time for filing a claim
    you agree that your sole and exclusive remedy for any problems or dissatisfaction with the spotify service is to uninstall any spotify software and to stop using the spotify service. You agree that spotify has no obligation or liability arising from or related to third-party applications or the content thereof made available through or in connection with the spotify service, and while your relationship with such third-party applications may be governed by separate agreements with such third parties, your sole and exclusive remedy, as with respect to spotify, for any problems or dissatisfaction with any third-party applications or the content thereof, is to uninstall or stop using such third-party applications.
    
    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will spotify, its officers, shareholders, employees, agents, directors, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, suppliers, or licensors be liable for (1) any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages; (2) any loss of use, data, business, or profits (whether direct or indirect), in all cases arising out of the use of or inability to use the spotify service, devices, third-party applications, or third-party application content, regardless of legal theory, without regard to whether spotify has been warned of the possibility of those damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose; or (3) aggregate liability for all claims relating to the spotify service, third-party applications, or third-party application content more than the greater of (a) the amounts paid by you to spotify during the twelve months prior to the first claim; or (b) $30.00.
    
    For clarification, these terms do not limit spotify's liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury to the extent that applicable law would prohibit such a limitation.
    
    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any claim arising under these terms must be commenced (by filing a demand or filing an individual action as specified under the arbitration agreement below) within one (1) year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period.
    
    Third-party rights
    you acknowledge and agree that the owners of the content and certain distributors (such as app store providers) are intended beneficiaries of these terms and have the right to enforce these terms directly against you. Other than as set out in this section, (1) these terms are not intended to grant rights to anyone except you and spotify; and (2) in no event shall these terms create any third-party beneficiary rights.
    
    If you have downloaded any of our mobile software applications (each, an "app") from the apple inc. ("apple") app store or if you are using the app on an ios device, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the following notice regarding apple. These terms are between you and spotify only, not with apple, and apple is not responsible for the spotify service and the content thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the spotify service. In the event of any failure of the spotify service to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify apple and apple will refund the applicable purchase price for the app to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the spotify service. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the spotify service or your possession or use of the spotify service, including: (1) product liability claims; (2) any claim that the spotify service fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (3) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and (4) claims with respect to intellectual property infringement. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third-party claim that the spotify service or your possession and use of the app infringe that third party's intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms, when using the spotify service. Apple, and apple's subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these terms, and upon your acceptance of these terms, apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these terms against you as a third-party beneficiary of these terms.
    
    Indemnification
    you agree to indemnify and hold spotify harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or related to: (1) your breach of any of these terms (including any additional spotify terms and conditions incorporated herein); (2) any user content you post or otherwise contribute; (3) any activity in which you engage on or through the spotify service; and (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.
    
    Governing law, jurisdiction, and jury trial waiver
    these terms and any dispute, claim, and/or controversy that in any way relates to or arises in connection with these terms or your relationship with spotify as a user of the spotify service ("dispute") are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york, except to the extent preempted by or inconsistent with federal law. Further, you and spotify agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in new york, new york, to resolve any dispute that is not subject to mandatory arbitration under the arbitration agreement below, and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.
    
    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the parties agree to waive any right to a jury trial.
    
    Arbitration agreement
    this arbitration agreement section sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which disputes between you and spotify will be resolved through individual arbitration ("arbitration agreement").
    
    Dispute resolution and arbitration
    subject to the exceptions set forth in the "exceptions to arbitration" section below, you and spotify agree that any dispute between you and spotify (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these terms) will be determined by binding individual (not class) arbitration. The arbitrator has the authority to rule on all issues except that a court has exclusive authority to: (1) decide arbitrability, as well as scope, validity, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement; (2) decide whether you and spotify have complied with the pre-arbitration filing requirements (including the requirements described in the "pre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period" section below); (3) enforce the prohibition on class or representative actions; (4) enforce the provisions regarding mass arbitrations; and (5) enjoin an arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with this arbitration agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys' fees and costs where allowable under applicable law), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these terms.
    
    Exceptions to arbitration
    you and spotify both agree that any dispute relating to any actual or alleged infringement of your or spotify's intellectual property rights shall be brought in the federal courts of new york, new york, and that nothing in this arbitration agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of your or spotify's rights, at any time, to elect to have an individual action heard in: (1) a u. S. Small claims court (so long as the action is litigated exclusively in small claims court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction); or (2) a court of law, in accordance with the jurisdiction and venue described in the "governing law, jurisdiction, and jury trial waiver" section above, seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. In addition, this arbitration agreement does not stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).
    
    No class or representative proceedings and class action waiver
    you and spotify agree that each may bring claims against the other in arbitration or litigation only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative action. Unless both you and spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief) and all appeals have been exhausted or the decision is otherwise final, then the parties agree that such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court only after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.
    
    Pre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period
    a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute ("notice") to the other. Notices to spotify must be sent by email to legal@spotify. Com, and notices to you must be sent to the email address associated with your spotify account. All notices must: (1) be personally signed by the party sending the notice; (2) provide the relevant user's name, email address associated with the user's spotify account, and spotify username; (3) describe with specificity the nature and basis of the dispute; and (4) set forth the alleged damage and harm suffered and the specific relief sought with a calculation for it.
    
    After a notice containing all of the information required above is received, the parties agree to engage in good faith for a period of sixty (60) days in an effort to resolve the dispute (this time period may be extended by agreement of the parties) ("informal resolution period"). The party receiving the notice may request a telephone or video settlement conference during the informal resolution period in an effort to facilitate resolution of the dispute ("informal settlement conference"). The informal settlement conference, if any, will take place at a mutually agreeable time, which can be after the sixty (60) day informal resolution period if needed to accommodate the parties' schedules. During the informal settlement conference, you and a spotify representative must both personally participate in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute without the need to proceed with arbitration. Any counsel representing the parties also may participate. Personal participation in an informal settlement conference will not be required if both you and spotify agree in writing.
    
    The notice, informal resolution period, and informal settlement conference are intended to give the parties a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of this "pre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period" section has not been met, the parties agree that a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration and, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator shall not accept or administer an arbitration nor demand fees in connection with such an arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party retains the right to raise non-compliance with the requirements of this section and seek appropriate relief in arbitration.
    
    Any applicable statute of limitations or contractual limitations period will be tolled for any claims and requests for relief set forth in a notice from the date that either you or spotify sends the other a fully complete notice until: (1) thirty (30) days after completion of the informal resolution period, if no informal settlement conference is held; or (2) thirty (30) days after completion of the informal settlement conference if an informal settlement conference is held ("tolling period").
    
    Neither you nor spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding until after the tolling period has ended.
    
    Arbitration rules and fees
    either you or spotify may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and spotify will be administered by national arbitration and mediation ("nam") in accordance with their rules applicable to the nature of the dispute, including the comprehensive dispute resolution rules and procedures and/or the supplemental rules for mass arbitration filings ("nam rules"), as modified by this arbitration agreement. You and spotify agree that the federal arbitration act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement (despite the choice of law provision above). The nam rules, as well as instructions on how to file a demand for arbitration ("demand") with nam, appear at www. Namadr. Com/resources/rules-fees-forms/. The demand must attach the relevant notice and be personally signed by the party initiating the arbitration (and their counsel, if represented).
    
    If nam is unavailable, unwilling, or otherwise unable to administer an arbitration in accordance with this arbitration agreement, then another administrator that will do so will be selected by agreement of the parties. If the parties cannot agree, then they will jointly petition a court to appoint an administrator that will do so. To start an arbitration, the claimant shall send a copy of the demand to nam and the other party. If you initiate arbitration, you shall serve the demand on spotify via email at legal@spotify. Com and to spotify's registered agent at ct corporation system, 28 liberty street, new york, new york, 10005. If spotify initiates arbitration, spotify shall serve the demand on you at the email address associated with your spotify account. The claimant must certify in the demand that the requirements set forth in the "pre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period" section above have been met, and must attach a copy of the notice to the demand.
    
    Each party retains the right to request a hearing in arbitration from the arbitrator. Any arbitration hearings will be conducted by phone or videoconference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines that a hearing should be conducted in person, the locale for such hearing shall be in the county or parish where you reside or at another agreed upon locale.
    
    As in court, any counsel participating in an arbitration certifies that they are complying with the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure 11(b), including a certification that the claim or the relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions available under the nam rules, federal rule of civil procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law against all appropriate represented parties and counsel.
    
    Spotify will pay all filing, administration, case-management, hearing, and arbitrator fees ("arbitration fees") if it initiates an arbitration. If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding, the allocation and payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the nam rules, unless a different allocation is required by court order or for this arbitration agreement to be enforced. You and spotify agree that arbitration should be cost effective for all parties. Either party may engage with the arbitration administrator around fee reductions and deferred payments.
    
    Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different users, but an arbitrator's ruling will not be binding in any proceeding involving different users. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve any disagreements as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. An arbitration award that has been satisfied may not be filed or entered in court.
    
    Mass arbitration
    if you elect to have your claim addressed as part of a mass arbitration (defined below), you agree to the additional procedures set forth below.
    
    If twenty-five (25) or more claimants submit notices or attempt to file demands raising similar claims, are represented by the same or coordinated counsel (regardless of whether the notices or demands are submitted simultaneously), and the parties cannot resolve the cases during the informal resolution period, all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration through staged sets of proceedings. You agree to this process even though it may delay the arbitration of your case.
    
    If these mass filing procedures apply to your case, the tolling period for your claims will be extended until your case is selected to proceed as part of a staged proceeding, withdrawn, opted out of arbitration (as set forth below), or otherwise resolved.
    
    First stage: in the first stage, counsel for the parties shall each select twenty-five (25) cases per side (50 cases total) to be filed in arbitration and to proceed individually in accordance with this arbitration agreement, with each case assigned to a separate and different arbitrator (unless the parties agree otherwise). In the meantime, any remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those cases unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After the first stage is completed, the parties shall engage in a global, non-binding, and confidential mediation of all remaining cases with a retired federal or state court judge, and spotify shall pay the mediator's fee.
    
    Second stage: if the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the mediation, the parties shall repeat the same process except that fifty (50) cases shall be selected per side (100 cases total) to proceed individually in accordance with this arbitration agreement, with each case assigned to a separate and different arbitrator (unless the parties agree otherwise). After the second stage is completed, the parties will again engage in a global, non-binding, and confidential mediation of all remaining cases with a retired federal or state court judge, with the mediator's fee paid for by spotify.
    
    If the parties are unable to resolve any remaining cases after a second global mediation session:
    
    option one: you and spotify may, separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have your case heard in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with these terms. You may opt out of arbitration by providing an individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out of arbitration to spotify via email at legal@spotify. Com within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the second global mediation session. Spotify may opt your case out of arbitration by sending an individual, signed notice of its intention to opt out of arbitration to your counsel via email no more than thirty (30) days following the expiration of your thirty (30) day opt-out period. Counsel for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines.
    
    Or
    
    option two: if neither you nor spotify elects to have your case heard in court consistent with option one, then you agree that your case will be resolved through continuing staged proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining cases exceeds two hundred (200), then two hundred (200) cases shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining cases is fewer than two hundred (200), then all of those cases shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. No more than five (5) cases within any set of two hundred (200) cases may be assigned to the same arbitrator to proceed individually, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those cases unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process.
    
    Throughout the staged process above, the arbitrators for the cases are encouraged to resolve the cases within one hundred twenty (120) days of appointment or as swiftly as possible thereafter, consistent with fairness to the parties. If any case selected for a staged set of proceedings is withdrawn prior to the arbitrator's award (and without the consent of the other party), another case shall be selected to proceed individually in arbitration consistent with the process set forth above.
    
    A court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enforce this "mass arbitration" section and, if necessary, to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations or the assessment or collection of arbitration fees. This "mass arbitration" section is intended to be severable from the rest of this arbitration agreement. If a court decides that the staging process set forth in this "mass arbitration" section is not enforceable (and after exhaustion of all appeals), then all cases may be filed in arbitration, but the payment of arbitration fees will be assessed as the arbitrations advance and arbitrators are appointed, rather than when the arbitrations are initiated.
    
    Enforceability
    if in the process of arbitrating or litigating a dispute this arbitration agreement is invalidated in whole, the parties agree that they may seek to resolve the dispute in a u. S. Small claims court or in the federal or state courts of new york, new york, consistent with the "governing law, jurisdiction, and jury trial waiver" section above. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each party may bring a dispute against the other party only in an individual capacity and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may participate in a class-wide settlement.
    
    7. About these terms
    under applicable law, you may have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.
    
    Changes
    we may make changes to these terms (including any additional spotify terms and conditions incorporated by reference herein) from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting the revised terms on the applicable spotify service (provided that, for material changes, we will seek to supplement such notice by email, an in-service pop-up message, or other prominent notice within the spotify service, or other means). Your use of the spotify service following any changes to these terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. Premium subscribers who do not wish to continue using the spotify service under the updated terms must close their spotify account prior to their renewal date or thirty (30) days after the effective date, whichever occurs first. If spotify makes any material change to the arbitration agreement (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending us a personally signed, written notice of your decision to opt out of those changes via email to tounotice@spotify. Com. This opt-out notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of when we notify users of the change and include: (1) your name, address, email address associated with your spotify account, phone number, and spotify username. Such an opt-out must be sent by you personally from your personal email address, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. The opt-out notice also must include a statement that you wish to reject the change to the arbitration agreement. Opting out of a material change to the arbitration agreement is not an opt-out of arbitration altogether.

    service: "Facebook",
    tos: `1. The services we provide
    our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the products and services described below to you:
    provide a personalized experience for you:
    your experience on facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads, and other content you see in facebook news feed or our video platform to the facebook pages you follow and other features you might use, such as facebook marketplace, and search. For example, we use data about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our products - to personalize your experience.
    Connect you with people and organizations you care about:
    we help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that matter to you across the meta products you use. We use data to make suggestions for you and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, facebook pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to become friends with. Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups, and organizations they care about.
    Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:
    there are many ways to express yourself on facebook to communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you - for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across the meta products (consistent with your settings), sending messages or making voice or video calls to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile as well as showing you insights on how others engage with your content. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on meta products.
    Help you discover content, products, and services that may interest you:
    we show you personalized ads, offers, and other sponsored or commercial content to help you discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many businesses and organizations that use facebook and other meta products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.
    Promote the safety, security, and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:
    people will only build community on meta products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality) of our products and services. We employ dedicated teams around the world, work with external service providers, partners and other relevant entities and develop advanced technical systems to detect potential misuse of our products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community, including to respond to user reports of potentially violating content. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment that may include - notifying you, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement. We share data across meta companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our products or to help keep meta products, users and the community safe. For example, we share information with meta companies that provide financial products and services to help them promote safety, security and integrity and comply with applicable law. Meta may access, preserve, use and share any information it collects about you where it has a good faith belief it is required or permitted by law to do so. For more information, please review our privacy policy.
    
    In some cases, the oversight board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and bylaws. Learn more here.
    Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:
    we use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that people can use our products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location. For example, technology like this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on facebook or instagram. We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our products.
    Research ways to make our services better:
    we engage in research to develop, test, and improve our products. This includes analyzing data we have about our users and understanding how people use our products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our privacy policy explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.
    Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the meta company products:
    our products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different meta company products that you use. For example, we use data about the people you engage with on facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on instagram or messenger, and we enable you to communicate with a business you follow on facebook through messenger.
    Ensuring access to our services:
    to operate our global services and enable you to connect with people around the world, we need to transfer, store and distribute content and data to our data centers, partners, service providers, vendors and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services. This infrastructure may be owned, operated, or controlled by meta platforms, inc. , meta platforms ireland limited, or its affiliates.

    2. How our services are funded
    instead of paying to use facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the meta products covered by these terms, you agree that we can show you personalized ads and other commercial and sponsored content that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off meta company products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you personalized ads and sponsored content that may be more relevant to you.
    Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our personalized ads system. This means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who like cycling). We then show their ad to people who we think might be interested.
    We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off meta products. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience, like the fact that women between the ages of 25 and 34 who live in madrid and like software engineering have seen an ad. We dont share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how meta ads work here.
    We collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above to you. You can learn about how we collect and use your data in our privacy policy. You have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you. Learn more.

    3. Your commitments to facebook and our community
    we provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:
    1. Who can use facebook
    when people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:
    provide for your account the same name that you use in everyday life.
    Provide accurate information about yourself.
    Create only one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.
    Not share your password, give access to your facebook account to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).
    We try to make facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use facebook if:
    you are under 13 years old.
    You are a convicted sex offender.
    We've previously disabled your account for violations of our terms or the community standards, or other terms and policies that apply to your use of facebook. If we disable your account for a violation of our terms, the community standards, or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.
    You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or software under applicable laws.
    2. What you can share and do on meta products
    we want people to use meta products to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):
    you may not use our products to do or share anything:
    that violates these terms, the community standards, or other terms and policies that apply to your use of our products.
    That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our products in such a way).
    That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.
    That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing anothers copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.
    You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam, or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with, or impair the proper working, integrity, operation, or appearance of our services, systemes, or products.
    You may not access or collect data from our products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.
    You may not proxy, request, or collect product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
    You may not sell, license, or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, except as provided in the platform terms.
    You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative, or groundless reports or appeals.
    We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in section 4. B.
    If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the community standards, well let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see section 4. B below.
    To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction.
    We also can remove or restrict access to content features, services, or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to meta.
    3. The permissions you give us
    we need certain permissions from you to provide our services:
    permission to use content you create and share: some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.
    You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on facebook and other meta company products you use. Nothing in these terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.
    However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a "license") to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our products and services as described in section 1 above.
    Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as meta products or service providers that support those products and services. This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems.
    You can delete individual content you share, post, and upload at any time. In addition, all content posted to your personal account will be deleted if you delete your account. Learn more about how to delete your account. Account deletion does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in shared albums which may continue to be visible to other album members.
    It may take up to 90 days to delete content after we begin the account deletion process or receive a content deletion request. If you send content to trash, the deletion process will automatically begin in 30 days unless you chose to delete the content sooner. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
    Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    where your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted);
    where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
    investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
    protect the safety, integrity, and security of our products, systems, services, our employees, and users, and to defend ourselves;
    comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data meta companies providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record keeping obligations required by law; or
    comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
    In each of the above cases, this license will continue until the content has been fully deleted.
    Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content: you give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions you have taken on facebook next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a facebook page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on facebook. Ads and content like this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've taken on meta products. You can learn more about your ad settings and preferences.
    Permission to update software you use or download: if you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.
    4. Limits on using our intellectual property
    if you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our products (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly permitted by our brand usage guidelines or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile, or reverse engineer our products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law or your conduct relates to the meta bug bounty program.

    4. Additional provisions
    1. Updating our terms
    we work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our products.
    We hope that you will continue using our products, but if you do not agree to our updated terms and no longer want to be a part of the facebook community, you can delete your account at any time.
    2. Account suspension or termination
    we want facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.
    If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our terms or policies, including in particular the community standards, we may suspend or permanently disable your access to meta company products, and we may permanently disable or delete your account. We may also disable or delete your account if you repeatedly infringe other peoples intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.
    We may disable or delete your account if after registration your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time, or if we detect someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account. Learn more about how we disable and delete accounts.
    Where we take such action well let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.
    You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your account by mistake.
    If you delete or we disable or delete your account, these terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 3, 4.2-4.5.
    3. Limits on liability
    we work hard to provide the best products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our products, however, are provided "as is, " and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content).
    We cannot predict when issues might arise with our products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these terms or the meta products (however caused and on any theory of liability, including negligence), even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these terms or the meta products will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.
    4. Disputes
    we try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.
    You and meta each agree that any claim, cause of action, or dispute between us that arises out of or relates to these terms or your access or use of the meta products shall be resolved exclusively in the u. S. District court for the northern district of california or a state court located in san mateo county. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the state of california will govern these terms and any claim, cause of action, or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, meta may bring any claim, cause of action, or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.
    5. Other
    these terms (formerly known as the statement of rights and responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and meta platforms, inc. Regarding your use of our products. They supersede any prior agreements.
    Some of the products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our commercial terms. If you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our music guidelines. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
    If any portion of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and if it cant be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
    You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these terms to anyone else without our consent.
    You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialized. If you enable it in your settings, only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar legal document expressing clear consent to disclose your content to that person upon death or incapacity will be able to seek limited disclosure of information from your account after it is memorialized.
    These terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
    We may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).
    We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But we may use feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
    We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

    tos: `1. User eligibility and registration
    a. Eligibility and age limitations. Only residents of the united states are eligible to register for a hulu account. If you are under the age of 13, you are not permitted to register for a hulu account. If you are at least 13 and under 18 years of age (or under the applicable age of majority in your state or territory of residence), you may register for a hulu account, but only if you have the consent of your parent or guardian, including consent to this agreement on your behalf, and for clarity, you may only modify an account with the consent of your parent or guardian. Please note that age requirements for purchase of and access to certain services may vary. The services are provided to individuals for their personal, noncommercial use only. Companies, commercial establishments, associations and other groups may not register for a hulu account or use the services.
    
    B. Registration and access. Only individuals that have registered for a hulu account, provide certain information (e. G. , a valid email address), and agree to this agreement are eligible to use the relevant services. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your username and password and for all activities that occur on or through your hulu account. However, if you allow others to access your hulu account, this agreement, as well any specific consents you may have provided to us, also applies to their access, use, and disclosure of information. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized access to your hulu account. We will not be responsible for any losses arising from the unauthorized use of your hulu account.
    
    C. Notices. Any notices we deliver to you may be made as follows: (i) by email to the last email address provided by you or (ii) by posting a notice on the services. For clarity, you consent to receive electronic communications from the services you subscribe to and further agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, and other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any applicable legal notification requirements. You agree to provide and maintain accurate, current and complete information, including your contact information for notices and other communications from us. You agree not to impersonate or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity, including using another persons username, password or other account information, or another persons name or likeness, or provide false details for a parent or guardian.

    2. Subscription terms
    a. Service tier and other offerings. When purchasing your subscription to the services, you may be presented with different plans or options (each a service tier). Different service tiers or other offerings, such as add-ons, live tv, or the disney bundle (as defined below), may be subject to differences in pricing, usage rules, eligibility, restrictions, features, and device availability.
    
    B. Subscription billing and auto-renewal. Your subscription to the services includes enrollment into an ongoing/recurring payment plan. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of the disclosed billing period, unless cancelled in accordance with the instructions for cancellation below. Payment will be charged to your chosen payment method at confirmation of purchase and at the start of every new billing period, unless cancelled. When you provide a payment method, we will attempt to verify the information you entered by processing an authorization hold. We do not charge you in connection with this authorization hold, but your available balance or credit limit may be reduced. Your billing period is the interval of time between each recurring billing date and corresponds to the term of your subscription. For purposes of this agreement, a day or date begins at 12:00 a. M. Eastern time and ends at 11:59 p. M. Eastern time of that same calendar day. Where applicable, charges for one or more services may be prorated for any partial month of service. To see your next recurring billing date, log in to your account and view your account details. You acknowledge that the timing of when you are billed may vary, including if your subscription began on a day not contained in a given month (e. G. If you have a monthly subscription and became a paying subscriber on january 31, your payment method would be billed next on february 28), due to free trials and other promotional offers, gift card redemptions, credits applied, or changes in your subscription or payment method. We may also offer you the ability to pause your subscription for a specified period of time. If you do not cancel before the end of the pause period, billing will resume automatically. We reserve the right to change our pricing. In the event of a price change, we will attempt to notify you in advance of the change by sending an email to the email address you have registered for your account. If you do not wish to accept a price change, you may cancel your subscription in accordance with the instructions included in that email and below. If you do not timely cancel your subscription, your subscription will be renewed at the price in effect at the time of the renewal, without any additional action by you, and you authorize us to charge your payment method for these amounts. We will not be able to notify you of any changes in applicable taxes. You are responsible for all third-party internet access charges and taxes in connection with your use of the services. Please check with your internet provider for information on possible internet data usage charges.
    
    C. Free trials and promotions. Your subscription to the services may begin with a free trial. Availability of a free trial is not guaranteed and, if one is available, is only available on the specified terms of the free trial. Eligibility for free trials may vary based on factors including the service tier selected, how recently you redeemed a free trial, and whether the service tier is part of a combined offering. Certain limitations may also exist with respect to combining free trials with any other offers. Your first payment will be charged to your chosen payment method immediately following the free trial, unless cancelled in accordance with the instructions for cancellation below. You can cancel your subscription at any time before the end of your free trial. We provide notice of the terms of the free trial at the time you register and you will not receive a separate notice that your free trial is about to end or has ended, or that your paid subscription has begun, unless required by law in particular jurisdictions or instances. We may also offer, in our sole discretion, promotions (e. G. , a promotional price, bundled subscription, device-specific offer or gift card) subject to promotional terms disclosed during your sign-up or in other materials provided to you. We will begin billing the same payment method we otherwise have on-file for your subscription at the then-current, non-promotional price after your promotion ends unless you cancel prior to the end of your promotion or unless otherwise disclosed.
    
    D. Hulu gift cards. We may make available gift cards redeemable for an eligible service. Gift cards may not be used in conjunction with, or in addition to, any special offer unless the terms of the special offer expressly indicate otherwise. The purchase and redemption of hulu gift cards are subject to the hulu gift card terms and conditions, which you can review at http: //hulu. Com/start/gifting_terms
    
    e. Cancellation and refund policy. You can cancel your subscription at any time before the end of the current billing period, free trial or promotion. Cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period unless otherwise disclosed. If you cancel, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period, unless you are subscribed through a free trial, promotional code or other credit, in which case cancellation may be effective immediately. If you modify your subscription to switch from one service to another service during your billing period, you may not have continued access to your original service. You must cancel your subscription prior to 11:59 p. M. Eastern time on the day before your next recurring billing date in order to avoid being charged for the next billing period. We do not refund or credit for partially used billing periods, although we may provide such refunds or credits on a case-by-case basis in our sole and absolute discretion. If you cancel, including if you switch your billing to a third-party, you will forfeit any service, referral, or redeemed gift card credits. To cancel your subscription to the services, log into your hulu account and follow the instructions on your account page. If you subscribed via a third party (e. G. Itunes, google play, amazon, or roku), please visit our help center at help. Hulu. Com for instructions on how to cancel.
    
    F. Payment details. We will keep your detailed payment information, such as credit card number and expiry date, on file. In the event your account or subscriptions are configured so that you receive separate bills relating to the disney bundle, we may consolidate such bills to reduce the number of separate charges you receive. We may share your payment information within the walt disney company (e. G. , disney+, espn+, marvel, pixar, etc. ), if you have consented to such sharing. You are responsible for keeping your payment details up-to-date by changing the details in your account settings. Where your details change or are due to expire, we may obtain or receive from your payment provider updated payment details including your card number, expiry date and 0/v (or equivalent). This enables us to continue to provide you access to the services. You authorize us to continue to charge your card using the updated information. In the event of a failed attempt to charge to your payment method (e. G. If your payment method has expired), we reserve the right to retry billing your payment method. If a payment is not successfully authorized due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, we may suspend or terminate your subscription. You will remain responsible for any amounts you fail to pay in connection with your subscription, including collection costs, bank overdraft fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys fees, and arbitration or court costs. You also agree that we may charge your payment method on file if you decide to restart your hulu subscription.
    
    G. Subscriptions obtained through third parties. If you obtain a hulu subscription via a third party (e. G. , an app store), that subscription is also subject to the third partys terms, and the provisions in this agreement concerning subscription purchase, billing, cancellation/refunds, and payment do not apply to that subscription to the extent this agreement conflicts with the applicable third partys terms regarding subscription purchase, billing, cancellation/refunds and payments. For subscriptions obtained via a third party, your billing relationship will be directly with the applicable third party. Any fees charged for your subscription to the services will be billed by the applicable third party using the payment information you have provided to such third party. To cancel a subscription to the services obtained via a third party, please follow the cancellation instructions set out by the applicable third party. You can visit our help center for instructions on how to cancel a subscription to the services obtained via a third party.
    
    H. Bundled subscription options. We may offer a hulu subscription bundled with other subscription services, including subscriptions to third-party products and services, e. G. , a wireless plan. Notice of the terms of the bundled subscription options will be provided to you at the time you register. Third-party subscriptions, products, and services are governed by terms of use issued by those third parties.
    
    I. The disney bundle. We are pleased to offer eligible subscribers, who are over 18, access to certain combinations of two or more of the hulu service tier(s) and the disney+ and espn+ service(s) you select (each, when subscribed to in this manner, a bundled service), for a discounted price as compared to the retail price of each plan when purchased separately (the disney bundle). This promotional offer may be modified or terminated at any time. Your subscription to the disney bundle may be subject to certain terms and conditions disclosed to you at the time of purchase. The disney bundle is only available in the united states.
    
    By purchasing the disney bundle through hulu and agreeing to this agreement, you also agree to the disney+ subscriber agreement, which is incorporated by reference and govern your use of the disney+ and/or espn+ service(s) you select and can be found at www. Disneyplus. Com/legal/subscriber-agreement.
    
    J. Pay per view events. We may also offer one-time pay per view events not otherwise included within your subscription. You will be charged for pay per view events at the time of purchase to your chosen payment method.
    
    K. Service tiers with or without ads. We offer different hulu service tiers, some with advertisements and some without. Service tiers that are without ads are free of commercial interruptions. However, such service tiers may still contain limited promotional content, such as brief clips about other content available on any service associated with the disney bundle, and branded content or sponsorship messaging. In addition, service tiers without ads may offer live content (as defined below) or special events that contain traditional commercial breaks. If you subscribe to multiple service tiers, the terms of one service tier may not impact those of another service tier. For example, if you subscribe to both the live tv service tier and another service tier featuring content on-demand without advertisements, you will still see advertisements while streaming content from the live tv service tier.
    
    L. Additional content. From time to time, we may offer the opportunity to watch content that is not included in your service tier. For example, subscribers to a service tier that is otherwise limited to on-demand streaming may be able to watch certain live content. We offer this additional content on a promotional basis and retain sole discretion regarding the availability of the content, eligibility to watch the content, and requirements to access the content.
    
    M. Linked destinations and advertising. If we provide links or pointers to other websites or destinations, you should not infer or assume that we operate, control, or are otherwise connected with these other websites or destinations. When you click on a link within the services, we will not warn you that you have left the services and are subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy policies) of another website or destination. This agreement does not govern your use of another website or destination.
    
    We are not responsible for the content or practices of any website or destination other than the hulu site, even if it links to the hulu site and even if the website or destination is operated by a company affiliated or otherwise connected with hulu. By using the services, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable to you for any content or other materials hosted and served from any website or destination other than the hulu site.
    
    N. Third party ads and services. We take no responsibility for and do not endorse any third-party advertisements or any third-party material posted where the services are available, nor do we take any responsibility for the products or services provided by advertisers. Any dealings you have with advertisers while using the services, including through engaging with interactive advertisements, are between you and the advertiser, and you agree that we are not liable for any loss or claim that you may have against an advertiser. If you provide any confidential or personal information or engage in any transaction through an advertisement, we are not responsible for such information or transaction and we encourage you to read the terms of use and privacy policy of the advertiser or other party collecting such information or engaging in such transaction.

    4. Usage terms
    a. Compatible devices and software. Use of the services requires compatible devices, and certain software may require periodic updates, and your use of the services may be affected by the performance of these elements. You can access the content with almost any internet-connected computer or through the hulu application available for certain mobile or other devices (internet connection required) (each, a compatible device). Additionally, certain components of the services or your service tier(s) may only be compatible with a subset of compatible devices or require download of certain software, even if other aspects of the services can be accessed on any compatible device. For specifics concerning supported devices, operating systems, web browsers and optimal streaming support please visit our help center. You can add a compatible device to your hulu account by downloading the hulu application to the compatible device and by signing into your hulu account through the application.
    
    B. Internet connection. You must have a high speed internet connection in order to access and use certain aspects of the services.
    
    C. Streaming content. The content can be streamed through the services over an active internet connection. The number of concurrent streams available for use may be subject to limitations by service tier, and such limitations may change from time to time at our discretion and may require device and account verification. Please visit our help center for more information on the number of concurrent streams permitted based on your service tier.
    
    D. Downloading content. The content may be available for temporary download for offline viewing on certain compatible devices based on your service tier. The number of temporary downloads available for compatible devices, and the length of time that certain temporary downloads remain available to you for offline viewing, may be subject to limitations by service tier, and such limitations may change from time to time at our discretion. Please visit our help center for more information on the limitations on temporary downloads that apply based on your service tier.
    
    E. Content availability. The services are not available to subscribers outside of the united states, and the content that we make available may be limited by law or by the rights that certain of our third-party content providers grant to us. The periods during which you can view each piece of content will vary based on the rights availability of such content and the terms of your subscription. Access to the services from locations where we do not have rights, that are not offered on your service tier, or where we do not make the services available is prohibited. Certain content available through the services may not be available in all territories within the united states. Certain live content, including sporting events, may be unavailable due to your location, blackouts, or device-specific restrictions set by sports leagues and other parties that control content rights. For example, your access to regional sports networks, if any, will be determined by your home (as defined below), even if you access the services from outside your home. Similarly, if you are in a home television territory of a team participating in a game, then the game may be blacked-out for viewing or live viewing as part of your live tv service subscription (or other applicable third-party service). Moreover, your access to live content from local affiliates, if any, will depend on the location of your device at the time you access the services. The geographic restrictions and blackouts referenced in this paragraph will be enforced according to the location from which you are accessing the applicable service tier or third-party services, and we may use different technologies and methods to verify your location. You may be required to enable location access on your device in order to access certain content.
    
    F. Home setting. If you subscribe to the live tv service tier, make sure to designate a residential, non-mobile internet network (home) when you set your home location as part of the registration and access process. Your home will be used to determine which streams are considered in-home or out-of-home, where relevant to the requirements of your subscription. In addition, for uninterrupted enjoyment of the live tv service tier, you should access the services on your mobile device from your home location every 30 days, or such other period described in our help center.
    
    G. Cloud dvr. The live tv service tier may provide the ability to record live tv content to your cloud dvr. Hulu may limit storage capacity and the amount of time such recordings can be stored on your cloud dvr and available to you. If your subscription  or your access to any of the content or networks/channels included in your subscription  is cancelled, suspended, interrupted, or otherwise discontinued, you may lose access to previously-made recordings, even if your subscription or that access resumes or is reinstated. Unfortunately, hulu is unable to guarantee error-free recording, storage, or playback. Other than your usage of the cloud dvr made available to you by hulu, you may not record, copy, store, or redistribute any content. You may only use your cloud dvr to the extent permissible under copyright and other applicable laws. Please visit our help center to learn more about recording live tv content.
    
    H. Future unavailability. It is possible that the services and/or some or all content may not be available for streaming or downloading at any given time including (i) during any maintenance or update periods; (ii) any power or server outages; (iii) as a result of war, riots, strikes, social unrest; or (iv) as a result of other matters beyond the control of us or third parties. We will take reasonable efforts to provide you with as much prior notice as possible; however, we shall have no liability to you in such event. There may be times when we have to remove certain features or functionality and/or devices or platforms from being able to access the services. We will do our best to let you know of any of these changes, usage rules and restrictions, but you acknowledge that we may do so in our sole discretion at any time without notice. You also agree that we will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the services, although if you are a subscriber and we suspend or discontinue your subscription to the services, we may, in our sole discretion, provide you with a credit, refund, discount or other form of consideration. However, if we terminate your account or suspend or discontinue your access to the services due to your violation of this agreement, then you will not be eligible for any such credit, refund, discount or other consideration.
    
    I. Promotional and experimental features. In our continued assessment of the services, we may from time to time, with respect to any or all of our users, experiment or otherwise offer certain features or other elements of the services, including promotions, features, advertisements, user interfaces, plans and pricing. You acknowledge that these are implemented in our sole discretion, may be subject to additional terms, and may not apply to every subscriber.

    Back to top
    6. Suspension and termination
    you agree that we may, in our sole discretion and without notice or liability to you, restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to part or all of the services, and to any content if we believe you are using or have used the services in violation of this agreement or applicable law or regulations or in any manner other than for their intended purpose and in accordance with all other guidelines and requirements applicable thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, we may restrict or suspend your access to your hulu account for cause, which cause includes but is not limited to (a) requests from law enforcement or other government authorities, (b) unexpected technical issues or problems, or (c) if we reasonably believe that your hulu account has been created fraudulently, your hulu account has been accessed fraudulently, or anyone uses your hulu account to commit fraud or for any purpose other than its intended purpose and in accordance with all of the requirements applicable thereto. We also reserve the right, but are not required, to terminate any hulu account that remains inactive for an extended period of time, e. G. , more than one year (failure to log in to your hulu account will constitute inactivity for purposes of this agreement).
    
    You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such restriction, suspension, or termination of your access to your hulu account or the content.
    
    We also reserve the right to take appropriate legal action against you for violating intellectual property rights, fraud, or similar grounds for termination.
    
    Our decision to delay exercising or enforcing any right or remedy under this agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or remedy with respect to any party.
    
    Upon termination of your hulu account, whether terminated based on our determination or at your request (other than a cancellation of your subscription, in which case your subscription will continue to the end of the billing period), you will lose the right to access streamed or downloaded content through the services.

    7. Binding arbitration and class action waiver
    please read this provision carefully, as it affects your rights under this agreement.
    
    There may be instances in which disputes arise between you and hulu. You and hulu agree that proceedings to resolve or litigate a dispute in any forum will be conducted on an individual basis.
    
    Neither you nor hulu will seek to have a dispute heard as a class action or private attorney general action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. You and we agree not to, and expressly waive any right to, file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. No arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitrations or proceedings.
    
    You and hulu agree to arbitrate, as provided below, all disputes between you and us (including any related disputes involving the walt disney company or its affiliates), that are not resolved informally, except disputes relating to the ownership or enforcement of intellectual property rights. Dispute includes any dispute, action, or other controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, between you and us concerning the services or this agreement, whether in contract, tort, warranty, statute, regulation, or other legal or equitable basis. You and hulu empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these terms or the formation of this contract, including, without limitation the arbitrability of any dispute, and any claim that all or any part of this agreement are void or voidable.
    
    A. In the event of a dispute, you and hulu agree to attempt to avoid the costs of formal dispute resolution by giving each other a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve a dispute informally. The claiming party must send to the other party a notice of dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving the notice, detailed factual information sufficient to evaluate the merits of the claiming partys individualized claim, and the specific relief sought, including whatever amount of money is demanded and the means by which the demanding party calculated the claimed damages. You must send any notice of dispute to hulu, llc, 2500 broadway, 2nd floor, santa monica, ca 90404, usa, attn: legal department. We will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you.
    
    B. You and hulu will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days beginning from the date the notice of dispute is sent. This informal negotiation requires an individual meetand-confer in person, telephonically, or via videoconference that addresses only the dispute between you and us. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also need to individually participate. Hulu will participate in the conference through one or more representatives, which may include our counsel. After the end of the sixty (60) day informal negotiation period and not before, and only after the completion of the dispute resolution conference with respect to a claim, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding regarding that claim. Alternatively, you may litigate a dispute in small claims court immediately if the dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court and you proceed only on an individual basis, whether or not you first negotiated informally or completed a dispute resolution conference. However, nothing in this paragraph is intended to prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating partys claims before, during, or after any dispute resolution conference or filing in small claims court.
    
    C. If you, on one hand, and hulu, on the other, do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, the dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the u. S. Federal arbitration act. You are giving up the right to litigate a dispute in court before a judge or jury. Arbitration will be administered by jams mediation, arbitration and adr services (jams) in accordance with the jams streamlined arbitration rules and procedures (the jams rules). The jams rules and instructions about how to initiate an arbitration are available at www. Jamsadr. Com or 1-800-352-5267.
    
    Arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. Proceedings that cannot be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or online, will take place in los angeles county, california; provided, however, that if you can demonstrate that arbitration in los angeles county would create an undue burden to you, jams may hold an in-person hearing in your hometown area. You and hulu agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in los angeles county, california, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may award damages to you individually as a court could, including declaratory or injunctive relief, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.
    
    In accordance with the jams rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or hulu) is responsible for paying the filing fee. If the arbitrator issues you an award of damages and: (a) that award is greater than the amount of our last written settlement offer; or (b) if we did not make a settlement offer, then we will pay for any jams case management fees and all professional fees for the arbitrators services, and will reimburse you for the filing fees you incurred in connection with the arbitration. However, if the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your claim was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards described in federal rule of civil procedure 11(b)), to the extent permitted by law, we will have the right to seek recovery of any jams case management fees and all professional fees for the arbitrators services that we incurred in connection with the arbitration. You would have the same right.
    
    Except as provided above with respect to jurisdiction in los angeles county, california, nothing in this arbitration agreement shall be construed as consent by hulu or its affiliates to the jurisdiction of any other court with regard to disputes, claims or controversies unrelated to the services or this agreement.
    
    If you have questions or concerns about the meaning of any provision of this arbitration agreement, please feel free to seek the counsel of an attorney. We thank you for understanding why it is important that we agree on the process for addressing disputes.

In order to use the services, you must have accepted these terms, which are: (a) presented to you when you create an account; and (b) available at all times when you access the services. If you dont accept them, you may not access or use our services.
    
    1. Your access to the services
    no one under 13 is allowed to use or access the services. We may offer additional services that require you to be older to use them, so please read all notices and any additional terms carefully when you access the services.
    
    By using the services, you state that:
    
    you are at least 13 years old and over the minimum age required by the laws of your country of residence to access and use the services;
    you can form a binding contract with reddit, or, if you are over 13 but under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, that your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these terms;
    you are not barred from using the services under all applicable laws; and
    you have not been permanently suspended or removed from the services.
    If you are accepting these terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or government entity, you represent that you have full legal authority to bind such entity to these terms.
    
    2. Privacy
    reddits privacy policy explains how and why we collect, use, and share information about you when you access or use our services. You understand that through your use of the services, you consent to the collection and use of this information as set forth in the privacy policy.
    
    3. Your use of the services
    subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these terms, reddit grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to: (a) install and use a copy of our mobile application associated with the services that is obtained from a legitimate marketplace on a mobile device owned or controlled by you; and (b) access and use the services. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you by these terms.
    
    Except and solely to the extent such a restriction is impermissible under applicable law, you may not, without our written agreement:
    
    license, sell, transfer, assign, distribute, host, or otherwise commercially exploit the services or content;
    modify, prepare derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any part of the services or content; or
    access the services or content in order to build a similar or competitive website, product, or service, except as permitted under the reddit api terms of use.
    We do not guarantee that the services will always be available or uninterrupted. We are always improving our services. This means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities; we will try to notify you beforehand, but that wont always be possible. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the services (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice to you. Any future release, update, or other addition to functionality of the services will be subject to these terms, which may be updated from time to time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the services or any part thereof.
    
    4. Your reddit account and account security
    to use certain features of our services, you may be required to create a reddit account (an account) and provide us with a username, password, and certain other information about yourself as set forth in the privacy policy.
    
    You are solely responsible for the information associated with your account and anything that happens related to your account. You must maintain the security of your account and immediately notify reddit if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your account without your permission. We recommend that you use a strong password that is used only with your account and enable two-factor authentication.
    
    You will not license, sell, or transfer your account without our prior written approval.
    
    5. Your content
    the services may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, audio, streams, or other materials (content), including content created with or submitted to the services by you or through your account (your content). We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, support, or guarantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any of your content.
    
    By submitting your content to the services, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to your content contained within these terms. Because you alone are responsible for your content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share content without all necessary rights.
    
    You retain any ownership rights you have in your content, but you grant reddit the following license to use that content:
    
    when your content is created with or submitted to the services, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, distribute, store, perform, and display your content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with your content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed anywhere in the world. This license includes the right for us to make your content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with reddit. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with your content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to your content.
    
    Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about reddit or our services that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that reddit may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.
    
    Although we reserve the right to review, screen, edit, or monitor your content, we do not necessarily review all of it at the time its submitted to the services. However, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove your content at any time and for any reason, including for violating these terms, violating our content policy, or if you otherwise create or are likely to create liability for us.
    
    6. Third-party content, advertisements, and promotions
    the services may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, which may be posted by advertisers, our affiliates, our partners, or other users (third-party content).

Your use of third-party content is at your own risk, and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such third-party content.
    
    The services may also contain sponsored third-party content or advertisements. The type, degree, and targeting of advertisements are subject to change, and you acknowledge and agree that we may place advertisements in connection with the display of any content or information on the services, including your content.
    
    If you choose to use the services to conduct a promotion, including a contest or sweepstakes (promotion), you alone are responsible for conducting the promotion in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to creating official rules, offer terms, eligibility requirements, and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations which govern the promotion (such as licenses, registrations, bonds, and regulatory approval). Your promotion must state that the promotion is not sponsored by, endorsed by, or associated with reddit, and the rules for your promotion must require each entrant or participant to release reddit from any liability related to the promotion.

    8. Moderators
    moderating a subreddit is an unofficial, voluntary position that may be available to users of the services. We are not responsible for actions taken by the moderators. We reserve the right to revoke or limit a users ability to moderate at any time and for any reason or no reason, including for a breach of these terms.
    
    If you choose to moderate a subreddit:
    
    you agree to follow the moderator guidelines for healthy communities;
    you agree that when you receive reports related to a subreddit you moderate, you will take appropriate action, which may include removing content that violates policy and/or promptly escalating to reddit for review;
    you are not, and may not represent that you are, authorized to act on behalf of reddit;
    you may not enter into any agreement with a third party on behalf of reddit, or any subreddits that you moderate, without our written approval;
    you may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation, consideration, gift, or favor from third parties;
    if you have access to non-public information as a result of moderating a subreddit, you will use such information only in connection with your performance as a moderator; and
    you may create and enforce rules for the subreddits you moderate, provided that such rules do not conflict with these terms, the content policy, or the moderator guidelines for healthy communities.
    Reddit reserves the right, but has no obligation, to overturn any action or decision of a moderator if reddit, in its sole discretion, believes that such action or decision is not in the interest of reddit or the reddit community.
    
    9. Copyright, trademark, the dmca, and takedowns
    reddit respects the intellectual property of others and requires that users of our services do the same. We have a policy that includes the removal of any infringing material from the services and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of our services who are repeat infringers. If you believe that anything on our services infringes a copyright or a trademark that you own or control, you may notify reddits designated agent by filling out our copyright report form or trademark report form, or by contacting:
    
    copyright agent
    reddit, inc.
    1455 market street, suite 1600

    also, please note that if you knowingly misrepresent that any activity or material on our service is infringing, you may be liable to reddit for certain costs and damages.
    
    If we remove your content in response to a copyright or trademark notice, we will notify you via reddits private messaging system. If you believe your content was wrongly removed due to a mistake or misidentification in a copyright notice, you can send a counter notification via our copyright counter notice form or to our copyright agent (contact information provided above). Please see 17 u. S. C. 512(g)(3) for the requirements of a proper counter notification.
    
    10. Paid services and payment information
    there are no fees for the use of many aspects of the services. However, some services, including reddit premium, and virtual goods, may be available for purchase (paid services). In addition to these terms, by purchasing or using reddit premium or our virtual goods, you further agree to the reddit premium and virtual goods agreement.
    
    Reddit may change the fees or benefits associated with the paid services from time to time with reasonable advance notice of material changes; provided, however, that no advance notice will be required for temporary promotions, including temporary reductions in the fees associated with the paid services.

We reserve the right to control the defense of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.
    
    13. Limitation of liability
    by using the services you agree that the reddit entities liability is limited to the maximum extent permissible in your country of residence. Liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. Reddit isnt liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability will not apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct, or if and to exclude our responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you.
    
    14. Changes to these terms
    we may make changes to these terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the revised terms and update the effective date above.

By continuing to access or use the services on or after the effective date of the revised terms, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the revised terms, you must stop accessing and using our services before the changes become effective.
    
    15. Additional terms
    because we offer a variety of services, you may be asked to agree to additional terms, policies, guidelines, or rules before using a specific product or service offered by reddit (collectively, additional terms). All additional terms are incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these terms, and to the extent any additional terms conflict with these terms, the additional terms govern with respect to your use of the corresponding services.
    
    If you use reddit premium or virtual goods, you must also agree to the reddit premium and virtual goods agreement.
    If you use the self-service platform for advertising, you must also agree to our reddit advertising platform terms.

    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we may suspend or terminate your account, moderator status, or ability to access or use the services at any time for any or no reason, including for violating these terms or our content policy.

    17. Miscellaneous
    these terms, together with the privacy policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these terms, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding your access to and use of the services. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. If any part of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these terms without reddits prior written consent. Reddit may, without restriction, assign any of our rights and obligations under these terms, at its sole discretion, with 30 days prior notice. Your right to terminate these terms at any time pursuant to section 16 remains unaffected.
    
    These terms are a legally-binding agreement between you and reddit, inc. If you have any questions about these terms, please contact us.

By creating an account for use of the services in a particular country or territory you are specifying it as your home country. To use our services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and internet access (fees may apply). Our services performance may be affected by these factors.
    
    B. Using our services
    
    payments, taxes, and refunds
    
    you can acquire content on our services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a transaction. Each transaction is an electronic contract between you and apple, and/or you and the entity providing the content on our services. However, if you are a customer of apple distribution international ltd. , apple distribution international ltd. Is the merchant of record for some content you acquire from apple books, apple podcasts, or app store as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant service. In such case, you acquire the content from apple distribution international ltd. , which is licensed by the content provider (e. G. , app provider (as defined below), book publisher, etc. ). When you make your first transaction, we will ask you to choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future transactions. On applicable apple hardware, if you enable touch id for transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all transactions with your fingerprint, and if you enable face id for transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all transactions using facial recognition. Manage your password settings at any time by following these instructions: https: //support. Apple. Com/ht204030.
    
    Apple will charge your selected payment method for any paid transactions, including any applicable taxes. If you have also added it to your apple wallet, apple may charge your selected payment method in apple wallet using apple pay. You can associate multiple payment methods with your apple id, and you agree that apple may store and charge those payment methods for transactions. Your primary payment method appears at the top of your account settings payments page.
    
    If your primary payment method cannot be charged for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you authorize apple to attempt to charge your other eligible payment methods in order from top to bottom as they appear on your account settings payments page. If we cannot charge you, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we may attempt to charge you again or request that you provide another payment method. If you pre-order content, you will be charged when the content is delivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the contents availability). In accordance with local law, apple may automatically update your payment information regarding your payment methods if provided such information by the payment networks or your financial institutions. Terms related to store credit and gift cards/codes are available here: https: //www. Apple. Com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/. For more details about how transactions are billed, please visit http: //support. Apple. Com/ht201359. All transactions are final. Content prices may change at any time. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of content, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the content or refund of the price paid, as determined by apple. From time to time, apple may suspend or cancel payment or refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, abuse, or unlawful or other manipulative behavior that entitles apple to a corresponding counterclaim.

    using our services and accessing your content may require an apple id. An apple id is the account you use across apples ecosystem. Use of game center is subject to this agreement and also requires a game center account. Your account is valuable, and you are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality and security.

You will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the start of the latest paid subscription period. If we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled the paid subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as you may update your payment method information. This may result in a change to the start of your next paid subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period, as displayed on your receipt. We reserve the right to cancel your paid subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your subscription.

To learn more about family sharing visit: https: //support. Apple. Com/ht201060.
    
    Purchase sharing: family sharings purchase sharing feature allows eligible content to be shared among up to six members of a family. The organizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay for all transactions initiated by family members. The organizer's eligible payment methods are used to pay for any transaction initiated by a family member (except when the family members account has store credit, which is always used first). Family members are acting as agents for the organizer when the organizers eligible payment methods are used. The organizer hereby agrees (1) to pay for such transactions; (2) that transactions initiated by family members are authorized; and (3) transactions will be charged to eligible payment methods in the manner indicated in section b above. Organizers are responsible for complying with their payment method contracts, and assume all risk related to sharing access to their eligible payment methods with family members. A receipt or invoice for any family member transaction is sent to the initiating family member and, if billed to the organizers payment method, also to the organizer.
    
    Ask to buy: ask to buy is a feature that allows an organizer to approve transactions initiated by a family member under age 18 (or the equivalent age of majority in your home country). Content shared by family members or acquired via content codes generally is not subject to ask to buy; content codes facilitating access to subscriptions are subject to ask to buy. The organizer must be the parent or legal guardian of any family member for whom ask to buy is activated. Ask to buy is enabled by default for any family member under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in their home country) and stays on until deactivated by the parent or legal guardian. If ask to buy is turned off after the family member turns 18 years old, it cannot be turned on anymore. Ask to buy does not require purchase sharing to be enabled.
    
    Family member changes: when a family member leaves or is removed from the family, the remaining family members may no longer be able to access the former members content, including content acquired with the organizers payment method.
    
    Family sharing rules: you can only belong to one family at a time, and may join any family no more than twice per year. You can change the apple id you associate with a family no more than once every 90 days. All family members must share the same home country. Not all content, including in-app purchases, subscriptions, and some previously acquired apps, are eligible for purchase sharing. Apple tv+, apple tv channels, apple one family, apple one premier, apple music family, apple arcade, apple news+, and apple fitness+ subscriptions are automatically enabled for family sharing. Subscriptions shared by a family may be subject to content usage limitations on a per subscription basis.
    
    E. Season pass and multi-pass
    
    a pass allows you to purchase and receive television content as it becomes available. A season pass applies to television content that has a limited number of episodes per season; a multi-pass applies to television content that is available on an ongoing basis. The full price of a season pass or multi-pass is charged at the time of the transaction. Season pass or multi-pass content is available for download up to 90 days after the last episode becomes available. If a content provider delivers to apple fewer tv episodes than planned when you purchased a season pass, we will credit to your apple id the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes that were not provided to apple.
    
    F. Additional app store terms (excluding apple arcade apps)
    
    license of app store content
    
    app licenses are provided to you by apple or a third party developer (app provider). Apple acts as an agent for app providers in operating the app store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the app provider. However, if you are a customer of apple distribution international ltd. , the merchant of record is apple distribution international ltd. , which means that you acquire the app license from apple distribution international ltd. , but the app is licensed by the app provider. An app licensed by apple is an apple app; an app licensed by an app provider is a third party app. Any app that you acquire is governed by the licensed application end user license agreement (standard eula) set forth below, unless apple or the app provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (custom eula). The app provider of any third party app is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the third party app, subject to local law. You acknowledge and agree that apple is a third-party beneficiary of the standard eula or custom eula applicable to each third party app and may therefore enforce such agreement. Certain apps, such as stickers and imessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the messages app drawer.
    
    In-app purchases
    
    apps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such apps (in-app purchases). In-app purchases that are consumed during the use of the app (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once. You must authenticate your account before making in-app purchases  separate from any authentication to obtain other content  by entering your password or using touch id or face id. You will be able to make additional in-app purchases for fifteen minutes without re-authenticating unless you have asked us to require a password for every purchase or have enabled touch id or face id. You can turn off the ability to make in-app purchases by following these instructions: https: //support. Apple. Com/ht201304.
    
    App maintenance and support
    
    apple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for apple apps only, or as required under applicable law. App providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for third party apps.
    
    App bundles
    
    some apps may be sold together as a bundle (app bundle). The price displayed with an app bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the app bundle. The app bundle price may be reduced to account for apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the app bundle.
    
    Search results and rankings
    
    when determining how to order the apps in search results, the main parameters considered are the metadata provided by app providers, how customers have engaged with the apps and the app store, and the popularity of the apps in the app store. These main parameters deliver the most relevant results to customer search queries.
    
    Licensed application end user license agreement
    
    apps made available through the app store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each app is subject to your prior acceptance of either this licensed application end user license agreement (standard eula), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the app provider (custom eula), if one is provided. Your license to any apple app under this standard eula or custom eula is granted by apple, and your license to any third party app under this standard eula or custom eula is granted by the app provider of that third party app. Any app that is subject to this standard eula is referred to herein as the licensed application. The app provider or apple as applicable (licensor) reserves all rights in and to the licensed application not expressly granted to you under this standard eula.
    
    A. Scope of license: licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the licensed application on any apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the usage rules. The terms of this standard eula will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the licensed application as well as upgrades provided by licensor that replace or supplement the original licensed application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a custom eula. Except as provided in the usage rules, you may not distribute or make the licensed application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense the licensed application except as expressly permitted in this agreement and, if you sell your apple device to a third party, you must remove the licensed application from the apple device before doing so. You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the usage rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the licensed application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the licensed application).
    
    B. Consent to use of data: you agree that licensor may collect and use technical data and related informationincluding but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripheralsthat is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the licensed application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.
    
    C. Termination. This standard eula is effective until terminated by you or licensor. Your rights under this standard eula will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.
    
    D. External services. The licensed application may enable access to licensors and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "external services"). You agree to use the external services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party external services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party external services. Data displayed by any licensed application or external service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by licensor or its agents. You will not use the external services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this standard eula or that infringes the intellectual property rights of licensor or any third party. You agree not to use the external services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that licensor is not responsible for any such use. External services may not be available in all languages or in your home country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such external services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any external services at any time without notice or liability to you.
    
    E. No warranty: you expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the licensed application is at your sole risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the licensed application and any services performed or provided by the licensed application are provided "as is" and as available, with all faults and without warranty of any kind, and licensor hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions with respect to the licensed application and any services, either express, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties and/or conditions of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, of fitness for a particular purpose, of accuracy, of quiet enjoyment, and of noninfringement of third-party rights. No oral or written information or advice given by licensor or its authorized representative shall create a warranty. Should the licensed application or services prove defective, you assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the above exclusion and limitations may not apply to you.
    
    F. Limitation of liability. To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event shall licensor be liable for personal injury or any incidental, special, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, corruption or loss of data, failure to transmit or receive any data (including without limitation course instructions, assignments and materials), business interruption, or any other commercial damages or losses, arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the licensed application, however caused, regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort, or otherwise) and even if licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for personal injury, or of incidental or consequential damages, so this limitation may not apply to you. In no event shall licensors total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.
    
    G. You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the licensed application except as authorized by united states law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the licensed application was obtained. In particular, but without limitation, the licensed application may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any u. S. -embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the u. S.

In such case, apple acts as an agent for the content provider in providing the content to you, and therefore apple is not a party to the transaction between you and the content provider. However, if you are a customer of apple distribution international ltd. , apple distribution international ltd. Is the merchant of record for the content you acquire, but such content is licensed by the content provider. The content provider reserves the right to enforce the terms of use relating to such content. The content provider is solely responsible for such content, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to such content.
